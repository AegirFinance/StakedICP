            StakedICP is a liquid staking solution for ICP. StakedICP lets users stake their ICP - without locking assets or maintaining infrastructure - whilst participating in on-chain activities, e.g. lending.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our goal is to solve the problems associated with initial ICP staking - illiquidity, immovability and accessibility - making staked ICP liquid, automating neuron compounding, and allowing usage in decentralised finance.

          When staking with StakedICP, users receive stICP tokens on a 1:1 basis representing their staked ICP. stICP balances can be used like regular ICP to earn yields and lending rewards, and are updated on a daily basis to reflect your ICP staking rewards.
          </p>

          <p>
          Rewards are based on the underlying NNS voting rewards, so can fluctuate based on the number of proposals (among other factors).
          </p>

          <p>
          Rewards are distributed daily. There can be up to 48 hours
          between when you stake, and when you receive your first rewards.
          </p>

          <p>
          In v1 of the protocol (released 2022), both the staking neurons and the canisters were controlled by the StakedICP team directly. This allowed us to ship faster and test the product.
          </p>

          <p>
          As of May 2023, the v2 of the protocol has launched. In v2, the staking neurons are no-longer directly controlled by the team, but are owned and controlled on-chain by the canisters themselves. The canisters, however are still managed by the StakedICP team. This allows the team to upgrade the code, adding features and continuing to build.
          </p>

          <p>
          Eventually, we would like for the protocol to be fully under community goverenance. Full DAO control is the goal.

          stICP is a token that represents staked ICP in the StakedICP neuron, combining the value of initial stake + staking rewards. stICP tokens are minted upon stake and burned when redeemed. stICP token balances are pegged 1:1 to the ICP that are staked by StakedICP. stICP tokenâ€™s balances are updated daily when staking rewards accrue.
          </p>

          <p>
          stICP tokens are a standard <a href="https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1">ICRC-1 token</a>, allowing you to earn ICP staking rewards while benefitting from e.g. yields across decentralised finance products. They do not confer any voting or governance rights.
          </p>

          <p>
          The stICP transaction fee is set at 0.0001. The same as normal ICP.

          The Internet Computer is soon to be the biggest staking economy in the space. However, staking on NNS requires daily work to ensure the best compounding rewards.In addition to this, for the best rewards, tokens are locked up for years.

          Through the use of a liquid-staking service such as StakedICP, users can eliminate these inconveniences and benefit from secure staking backed by industry leaders.

          There exist a number of potential risks when staking ICP using liquid staking protocols.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Smart contract security
                <br />
                StakedICP's code has been reviewed internally and externally, but it hasn't undergone a formal audit. While we've taken steps to ensure its quality, it's important to acknowledge the potential for bugs. Our code review process helps identify issues, but it's impossible to guarantee a completely bug-free code. We're committed to transparency about this reality. Make sure to conduct your own due diligence and research before making any decisions. Always DYOR.
                <br />

              </li>

              <li>
                Internet Computer - Technical risk
                <br />
                StakedICP is built atop experimental technology under active development, and there is no guarantee that the Internet Computer has been developed error-free. Any vulnerabilities inherent to the Internet Computer brings risk with it.
              </li>

              <li>
                Internet Computer - Adoption risk
                <br />
                The value of stICP is built around the staking rewards associated with the Dfinity Internet Computer. If the Internet Computer fails to reach required levels of adoption we could experience significant fluctuations in the value of ICP and stICP.
              </li>

              <li>
                StakedICP key management risk
                <br />
                The StakedICP canisters use the Internet Computer's Chain-key transactions to own and control the staking neurons.
              </li>

              <li>
                stICP price risk
                <br />
                Users risk an exchange price of stICP which is lower than inherent value due to withdrawal restrictions on StakedICP, making arbitrage and risk-free market-making impossible. StakedICP is driven to mitigate these risks and eliminate them entirely to the extent possible. Despite this, they may still exist and, as such, it is our duty to communicate them.

          To ensure maximum staking rewards, all ICP earned while staked, is automatically merged into the StakedICP neurons. While there's currently no way to withdraw ICP from staking, stICP holders may soon exchange their stICP to ICP on liquidity pools.
